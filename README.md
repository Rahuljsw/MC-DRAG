# mc_drag
in this repository there are parts of mc_drag source cod I wrote as well as the documentation which i am coauthor
the code is based on the original MC DRAG algorithm that was created using FORTRAN
by analyzing the original source code and documentation written by McCoy we established a model which behaves really similar to the first version of MC DRAG
